To run my demo ensure you have all the python requirements (see requirements.txt)
Then simply run "python main.py" in the Engine folder.

To progress through the demo press ENTER.
	DO NOT press enter while you cannot use scroll to change the camera angle.
	I did not implement multithreading so the main process is doing calculation
	and you may accidentally make it skip a step and break.

At any point where calculation is not happening you can use scroll to rotate the view
	This was designed for laptop trackpad scroll so it will
	be weirdly slow if you use a mouse.

Once you reach the end of the demo use SPACEBAR to progress through the views
